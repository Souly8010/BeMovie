# Projec BeMovie

## It's what ?

Project made in html, css / scss and Js to make a static movie website, which allows to see the trends of movies by swiping.
I had to use an api => (https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) to do this one.

site deployment: https://souly8010.github.io/BeMovie/ .
